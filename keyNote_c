The c executable will run despite run but will produce the wrong result.

The make command is use to built c source file into executable that could be run.

You can create a Makefile to specify how you want the program to be build.

Introducing Valgrind
Vagrind is a program that runs your program and then reports on all of the horrible mistakes that is made.

Learn to know how to install things from source
Steps: 
Download a source acrchive file to get the source
use the md5sum to make sure it matches the one on the site
unpack the acrchive to extract the file onto your computer
Run ./configure to setup build configurations
Run make it build just like you've been doing
Run sudo make install to install it onto your computer

Follow the above steps to install vagrind

Fix your program using valgrind and the compiler as your guide
an #include is a way to import  the contents of one file into a source file.C has the convention of using .h extensions for header files, which then contain lists of functions you want to use in your program
c makes a distinction between single quote for a char and double quote for string of charaters char[]
You get a segmentation fault when you pass the wrong type of data type and attempt to use it
when valgrind is run and you can compiler issuing line number that is quite extremmely and unreasonable value use this option
 valgrind --track-origins=yes the executable
